### Brief Intro

In this program, two spheres of different sizes are rotating, and they can be moved and resized. Their surface texture can be changed through buttons, and it's provided with a constant distant light source. Use `w, s, a, d` to walk through the scene and `p, o` to change the projection way (perspective or ortho).

- How to run?

  Clone to local and open the `demo.html` file in a browser. 

  Note that there may be a browser limit. IE explorer and Microsoft Edge have been tested. Google Chrome can not show local texture images for security reasons.

- File Structure

  Do not change the `common` folder, it's the library.

  `demo` is my code, there is a `html` and a `js` file inside.

  `Images` contains all the images needed.
